<p>Here we can post information about what we discussed at code review this week. So far, it seems like having code review every two weeks would work well with most people's schedule.  </p>

<h2>Topics This Week</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Constructing a .py file</li>
  <li>Data types: strings, ints, floats</li>
  <li>Binary operators: /, +, % </li>
  <li>Data structures: list</li>
  <li>Iterators: for and while loop</li>
</ol>

<h3>Constructing a .py file</h3>
<p>A python executable is created by appending .py to the end of your file. Usually, you will also see that the first line begins with a hash tag (<code>#</code>) and bang symbol (<code>!</code>) followed by a file path. This indicates the <code>file path</code> pointing to the version of python you should use. This line is not required for a python script to run. However, it can be useful for indicating the version of python you used when writing the code, which may be helpful for others.</p>
<pre><code>#!usr/bin/python  
</code></pre>

<p>When looking at examples of a polished code base, you will commonly see import statements at the beginning of the file. Although it is not required to collect all the import statements at the head of the file, this habit makes the script very readable for you and others. There are a few notable recommendations for using import statements. Usually, imports should be on separate lines.</p>

<p>Recommended:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import sys</code></pre>

<p>Not recommended:</p>

<pre><code>import sys, os</code></pre>

<p>It is also useful to format import statements in a way that allows you to only import the module that you need. This can really help make your code readable for others. For example: </p>

<pre><code>from subprocess import Popen, PIPE</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, you may want to use a shorthand for a module or library that you will be using repeatedly in your script. This can be accomplished using this syntax:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np</code></pre>

<h3>Data variable types: strings, ints, floats</h3>
<p>A variable represents a memory location on your device used to store information. When you create a variable, a location is setup in memory with the variable name as an identifier for that location and the value stored at that location. For example, you can create a variable called "a" with a value of 5 using the 'assignment' operator (<code>=</code>). Note: The <code>=</code> symbol has a different meaning than it does in mathematics. The assignment operator follows the syntax: left-hand-side (variable name) = right-hand-side (value)</p>

<pre><code>a = 5
</code></pre>

<p>After the variable assignment has been executed, a location in memory is allocated, the data <code>5</code> is stored there, and the information stored at that location can be retrieved by calling the variable name <code>a</code>.</p>

<pre><code>print a</code></pre>

<p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimal or characters in these variables. Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.</p>

<p>The data type of a variable determines how operators and other methods will behave when the variable is passed to these functions. The data type of a variable can be accessed by calling the <code>type()</code> method</p>

<pre><code>print type(a)</code></pre>

<h3>Binary operators:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /,&nbsp;&nbsp;+,&nbsp;&nbsp;%</h3>

<p>Binary operators are functions that accept two arguments and have a special syntax (akin to a mathematical expression). Python offers several arithmetic operators [<code>+</code>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>-</code>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>/</code>,&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>*</code>,&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>%</code>,&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>**</code>,&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>//</code>). Notably, some operators have different functions depending on the variable types that are passed as arguments.</p>

<table>
<caption><span style="font-weight:700;">The <code>/</code> operator:</span> performs integer or float division</caption>
  <th>Input</th>
  <th>Function</th>
  <th>Output</th>
  <tr>
    <td><code>5 / 2</code></td>
    <td>Integer Division</td>
    <td><code>2</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>5.0 / 2</code></td>
    <td>Float Division</td>
    <td><code>2.5</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>float(a) / 2</code></td>
    <td>Fload Division</td>
    <td><code>2.5</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Data structures: list</h4>
<h4>Iterators: for and while loops</h4>

<p>There are several data types available in python. Some data types hold only one value. These types include: str (short for string), int (short for integer), and float (decimal point number).</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3]
animals = ['panda', 'fox', 'dog', 'kangaroo']

length = len(animals)
print length
my_range = range(length)
print my_range

for number in range(len(animals)):
  print animals[number]  
</code></pre>
