<p>Here we can post information about what we discussed at code review this week. So far, it seems like having code review every two weeks would work well with most people's schedule.  </p>

<h3>Topics This Week</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Constructing a .py file</li>
  <li>Data types: strings, ints, floats</li>
  <li>Binary operators: +, /, % </li>
  <li>Data collections: list</li>
  <li>Iterators: for and while loop</li>
</ol>

<h4>Constructing a .py file</h4>
<p>A python executable is created by appending .py to the end of your file. Usually, you will also see that the first line begins with a hash tag (<code>#</code>) and bang symbol (<code>!</code>) followed by a file path. This indicates the <code>file path</code> pointing to the version of python you should use:</p>
<pre><code>#!usr/bin/python  
</code></pre>

<h4>Data variable types: strings, ints, floats</h4>
<p>A variable represents a memory location on your device used to store information. When you create a variable, a location is setup in memory with the variable name as an identifier for that location and the value stored at that location. For example, you can create a variable called "a" with a value of 5 using the 'assignment' operator (<code>=</code>). Not the same as the 'equals' sign in mathematics</p>

<pre><code>my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3]
animals = ['panda', 'fox', 'dog', 'kangaroo']

length = len(animals)
print length
my_range = range(length)
print my_range

for number in range(len(animals)):
  print animals[number]  
</code></pre>


<p>There are several data types available in python. Some data types hold only one value. These types include: str (short for string), int (short for integer), and float (decimal point number).</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3]
animals = ['panda', 'fox', 'dog', 'kangaroo']

length = len(animals)
print length
my_range = range(length)
print my_range

for number in range(len(animals)):
  print animals[number]  
</code></pre>
