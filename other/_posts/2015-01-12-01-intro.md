Textbooks are optional. If you’re new to programming, I recommend purchasing the textbooks.

## Lecture format

- Bring your laptop to class everyday 
- Lecture notes posted on Moodle before class • Reviewthembeforecomingtoclass
- Most lecture notes are code files
- We will go through those files, re-creating them in lecture.
- We will be writing code in this class, in lecture, here, in this auditorium.

## Due this week


## Virtual machine development environment

Lots of different operating systems

- They all work differently.
- Debugging code on every OS is a nightmare.

The virtual machine is another “pretend” computer running on your computer, regardless of your OS.

Provides consistency.

Uses a Virtual Machine, and An image (OS, programs)

## A final word on programming

- It takes practice...don’t give up
- If you are new to programming, don’t be intimidated by classmates who started programming when they were 12.
- Work together to solve problems
- When it works, it’s magical (I still think so after many years in this field.)
