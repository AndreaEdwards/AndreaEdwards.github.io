# Lab 4—Loops

## Objectives

- Write a program to:

  1. use the *expression form* of if
  2. use *for* loop
  3. use *while* loop

## Exercise

###Part 1:
Write a program to prompt the user for the height of a mountain in feet (fts). Name your program 'Lab4Part1.py'

Use the expression form of if to display “Really small mountain” if the input that is height of the mountain is 141ft (Height of Mount Wycheproof). Inputs other than 141ft should display “Not the smallest mountain in the world”.

###Part 2:
Write a program to set a counter variable to 0 and increment it by 1 using while loop until value of counter is 20. Then generate an infinite while loop to print the value of counter variable.  Name your program 'Lab4Part2.py'

###Part 3:
Write a program to take 5 strings as inputs. Store all the five strings in a list. Traverse through each element in the list and convert each string to uppercase and print them. Name your program 'Lab4Part3.py'

*Note:* Take strings in all lower case characters as input.

Example:

Input:

    introduction
    to
    programming
    lab 
    four

Output:

    INTRODUCTION
    TO
    PROGRAMMING
    LAB 
    FOUR
