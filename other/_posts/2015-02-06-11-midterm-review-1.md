# Midterm 1 review

Bring questions and code samples to lecture and we'll discuss them in class.
There's also a sample exam on Moodle to complete and submit.

Some good ways to study for the exam:

- Review the lecture notes and understand the code samples.
- Review chapters 2, 5, 7, and 8 in [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf).
- Write code!
