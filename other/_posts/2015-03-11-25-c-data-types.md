# C++ data types

The sample code we worked through in class is below. We used the
[Coffee Talk with Linda Richman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Talk)
Saturday Night Live skit as our example.

## topics.h

    #include <string>
    #include <vector>

    using namespace std;

    vector<string> generate_topics();


## topics.cc

    #include "topics.h"

    vector<string> generate_topics() {
        vector<string> topics;
        topics.push_back("The Partridge Family were neither partridges, nor a family. Discuss.");
        topics.push_back("Milli Vanilli is neither a Milli or a Vanilli. Discuss.");
        topics.push_back("Palmolive – it's neither palm, nor olive. Discuss.");
        topics.push_back("Grape-Nuts – it contains neither grapes, nor nuts. Discuss.");
        topics.push_back("Rhode Island is neither a road nor is it an island. Discuss.");
        return topics;
    }


## coffee.cc

    #include <string>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <time.h>
    #include <random>

    #include "topics.h"

    using namespace std;


    int main() {
        vector<string> my_topics = generate_topics();

        srand(time(NULL));

        int choice = rand() % 5;
        string topic = my_topics[1000];

        cout << "Topics are " << my_topics.size() << "choice is " << choice << endl;
        cout << "random topic is " << topic;
        return 0;
    }
