# Arrays & for loops

A look at arrays as blocks of memory and for loop syntax.

## demo.cc

Compile with `g++ demo.cc --std=c++11 -o demo`.

    #include <iostream>

    // Create a constant to use for the array length.
    #define LENGTH 3

    using namespace std;

    // Arrays do not know how many items they contain. We must
    // pass the length with the array.
    int sum(int items[], int length) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            sum = sum + items[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

    int main() {
        // const int LENGTH = 3;
        int numbers[LENGTH] = {12, 22, 32};

        cout << "int is how many bytes? " << sizeof(int) << endl;
        cout << "int[3] is how many bytes? " << sizeof(numbers) << endl;

        cout << "address item 0 " << numbers + 0 << endl;
        cout << "address item 1 " << numbers + 1 << endl;
        cout << "address item 2 " << numbers + 2 << endl;
        // This memory address is not owned by our program.
        cout << "address item 3 " << numbers + 3 << endl;

        cout << "item 0 " << numbers[0] << endl;
        cout << "item 1 " << numbers[1] << endl;
        cout << "item 2 " << numbers[2] << endl;

        // Reading past end of array into random memory.
        cout << "item 3 " << numbers[3] << endl;
        cout << "item 4 " << numbers[4] << endl;
        cout << "item 5 " << numbers[5] << endl;

        // Using range-based for syntax.
        for (int number : numbers) {
            cout << "number is " << number << endl;
        }

        int total = sum(numbers, 10);
        cout << "total is " << total << endl;

        {
            // Inside new block scope `total` is a new variable.
            int total = 1234;
        }

        cout << "total is " << total << endl;

        return 0;
    }
