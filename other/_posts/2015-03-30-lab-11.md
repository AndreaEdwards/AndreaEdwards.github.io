# Lab 11—Functions, for loop and arrays

## Objectives

1.	Use functions.
2.	Use nested `for` loops.
3.	Use two dimensional arrays.

Write a program to generate `8x8` checker board composed of *red* and *black* squares.
Following are the steps to populate the board:

1.	Take a two dimensional character array of size 8x8, named board.
2.	Example of 4x4 matrix:

        char board[4][4]=

            {‘ ’,’b’,‘ ‘,‘b’},

		        {‘ ’,’ ’,‘ ‘,‘ ’},

		        {‘ ’,’ ’,‘ ‘,‘ ’},

		        {‘r’,’ ’,‘r‘,‘ ’}

3.In the same format as above, create an 8x8 checker board where `b` is for black checkers and `r` for red checkers. The empty squares are denoted by spaces in the array.

Now, create a function named `displayBoard` which prints out the board. The `displayBoard` function should take the board array as a parameter.

### Syntax

    void displayBoard(char board[8][8]) {
        // print the board
    }

Use a nested for loop inside the `displayBoard()` to print out the board.

Finally, create the `main` function that calls the `displayBoard()` inside it.

### Output

      0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |
     0 *| b| *| b| *| b| *| b|
     1 b| *| b| *| b| *| b| *|
     2 *| b| *| b| *| b| *| b|
     3 *| *| *| *| *| *| *| *|
     4 *| *| *| *| *| *| *| *|
     5 r| *| r| *| r| *| r| *|
     6 *| r| *| r| *| r| *| r|
     7 r| *| r| *| r| *| r| *|
