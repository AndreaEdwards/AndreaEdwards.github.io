# IO Streams

## Decimal to binary

A diversion into converting a decimal number to binary.
Compile with `g++ bits.cc -o bits`.

## Streams

A stream is an abstraction over anything from which we can read or
to which we can write. The `cin` and `cout` built-in streams are
connected to the keyboard input device and display output device.
We'll create streams connected to files.

Compile with `g++ streams.cc -o streams`.
